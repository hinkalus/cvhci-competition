# 2018/2019 CVHCI Competition
This is the repo for the competition [2018/2019 CVHCI](http://141.3.14.114/judge19/). There are my solutions for all three assignments. These solutions were the best ones, as one can see in the ranking (username: fanta3). More details about the assigmnents could be found on official webpage.

To run this project:
1) Download or clone this repo
2) In terminal go to repo directory and run `direnv allow` and wait till all requirements are installed.
3) Scripts for all the assignments can be found in `main` folder.
4) The datasets can be found on official webpage.
5) Add every dataset folder to `data/data_a{assignment_number}`.

P.S. I use also some other datasets and other tricks, thats why you can have the score lower then my on competition web page.
